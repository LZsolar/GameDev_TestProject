Basic setup (10 min)
Time system design (15 min)
Implement Time system(1 hr)

In game collider for Time system(45min)

* forget to use collider

Basic player attack(30 Min)

Enemy movement (30min)

* Having trouble detect combat state

Detect combat state + minislime spawning after death (1 hr)

adjust combat script + health system(40 min)



design inventory system (1 hr)

from now, learning from this tutorial https://youtu.be/oJAE6CbsQQA?si=DbsIyHM7y\_Y0vfOS

* something not in tutorial but added

-> separate stacked limit

-> Item bin

Approx Time for everything related to inventory (6 hr)



Making player can attack only in combat





add where item can be craft





\[ Things that can still improve ]

* drag and drop to stack item

Suggestion -> add code that check when drop if it can be stack

* Craft when material is enough but in separate slot

Suggestion -> loop check if all the material in inventory is enough and loop again to delete item
